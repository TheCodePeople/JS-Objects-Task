4. Test your object in the console to make sure it works as expected.

## Task Instructions

1. Choose your favorite movie.
2. Create a JavaScript object that represents a movie with the following properties: (30 pts)
   - `title` (a string)
   - `year` (a number)
   - `director` (a string)
   - `actors` (a string)
   - `rating` (a number)
   - `timesWatched` (a number, representing the number of times you have watched the movie)
3. The movie object should also have the following methods: (40 pts)
   - `recommend()`: Prints a message recommending the movie to a friend.
   - `watch()`: This method increments the `timesWatched` property by 1, representing that the movie has been watched one more time.
   - `setRating(newRating)`: This method takes a new rating as an argument and updates the `rating` property of the movie object with the new value.
   - `addActor(actorName)`: This method takes an actor's name as an argument and appends it to the `actors` property, which represents the list of actors in the movie.
   - `isPopular()`: This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the movie is popular or not, based on its rating (popular > 8).
   - `summary()`: Prints a paragraph summarizing the movie's information, including the title, year, director, actors, and rating.
4. Create a copy of the object. (Hint: You can use the spread operator (...) or the Object.assign() method) (20 pts)
5. Modify the properties of the new object to represent another favorite movie. (5 pts)
